# i18n Conventions

This is just a first approach, under revision.

## Objective of having a CONVENTION on i18n

  * maintain the lesser amount of files as possible
  * keep trans keys as short and readable as possible
  * minimize duplication
  * still identify the meaning of the wording in case the lang fetch fails
  * optimize file loading


# Application-Wide

Most short words will be used among all the app, such as buttons and nav items.

Keys will be likely to:

  * be needed all along the application, almost everywhere
  * be short strings in order to easily reference them
  * be kept in a single file for faster loading

    elementType.name

### Model Attributes

Many words will be used among all the app, most of them will be model-related.

Keys will be likely to:

  * be needed in different modules, always with the same meaning
  * refer different strings for the same item depending on the element type that holds it

    contextName/modelName.elementType.attributeName

### View-Specific Elements

Each view may have view-specific texts, like instructions, messages, alerts, errors which are only referenced from that single view.

Keys will be likely to:

  * be needed in a single view
  * refer to long texts

    contextName/viewName.elementType.codeName
