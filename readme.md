# YARS
## Yet Another Reservation System

*YARS* is a web based reservations system under [Laravel 4 PHP Framework](http://github.com/laravel/framework).

So far, I've started *from scratch* to move a tiny-but-growing application called *xbooking* under [Code Igniter 2 PHP Framework](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter). You can see a [LIVE DEMO HERE](https://xbooking.com.ar/demo/). This application is already working but has reached it's limits on scalability and maintainability of the code, and is only available in *spanish*.

The current milestone is getting the basic *Contact Address Book* working on clean code, while trying to achieve:

 - Isolated Business Logic from Controllers
 - Translation Ready files
 - Uniform HTML markup rendering on views

Despite this sounds very a basic goal, it's important to start from the very beginning considering these. This was not easy to achieve with Code Igniter when the app started to grow up.

This is just the beginning, stay tuned :)

Documentation will be available soon.
