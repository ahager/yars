## YARS: Yet Another Reservation System

*YARS* is a web based reservations system under [Laravel 4 PHP Framework](http://github.com/laravel/framework).

So far, I've started *from scratch* to move a working application under [Code Igniter 2 PHP Framework](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter). This application is already working but has reached it's limits on scalability and maintainability of the code.

This is just the beginning, stay tuned :)

## Official Documentation

Documentation will be available soon.
